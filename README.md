# Email Related Files to Creator

Utilization of the System.Net.Mail.MailMessage class within Aras Innovator can be utilized to create custom Emails to send to specific users by using a Server-Side method.

The method code provided in this sample is used to send an Email to a Document create containing all related files as attachments to the email. This method is then called from a Server Side action against the Document Item.
